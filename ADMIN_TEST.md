## Admin Dashboard Test Instructions

### Testing the New Admin-Only Flow

1. **Regular User Login:**
   - Go to the website
   - Login with a regular user account
   - Should see the full website (header, products, etc.)

2. **Admin User Login:**
   - Go to the website
   - Login with an admin account
   - Should automatically show ONLY the admin dashboard
   - Should NOT see the regular website components (header, products, etc.)

3. **Admin Logout:**
   - While in admin dashboard, click the "Logout" button in the sidebar
   - OR click the "✕" button in the top-right corner
   - Should log out and return to the regular website

### Admin Test Account
- Use the existing admin account from your database
- Email: admin@srrfarms.com (or whatever admin account you have)

### Expected Behavior
✅ Admin users see ONLY the admin dashboard
✅ Regular users see the full website
✅ Logout button properly logs out admin users
✅ No more admin button in the header for admin users
✅ Clean admin-only interface

### Key Changes Made
1. **App.tsx**: Added admin detection logic
2. **AdminDashboard.tsx**: Added logout functionality
3. **Conditional Rendering**: Admin users bypass the regular website entirely
